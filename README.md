CoderCamps Individual Project - Final version

An individual project done over the course of a couple weeks during my time attending CoderCamps. 
It is a tool management system that allows users to checkout various tools for use, track 
the usage of the tools (i.e. machine hours) and track users tool use. The page is still 
needs some work. The view could use some improvment and the administrators ability to 
add/edit/delete users and tools still needs to be implemented.
